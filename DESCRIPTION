Description: Jamie R. NuÃ±ez, Christopher R. Anderton, and Ryan S. Renslow recently
  [introduced optimized color maps] (https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1712/1712.01662.pdf)
  for the scientific community. This so-called "cividis" colormap is generated by optimizing the 
  "viridis" colormap and is optimal for viewing by those with or without color vision deficiency (CVD),
  a different visual perception of colors that affects 8.5% of the human population.
  This colormap was developed as a Python module called "cmaputil".
